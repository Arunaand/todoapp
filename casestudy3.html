      <h1>Redesigning Federal Website: <br>Federal Communications Commission</h1>
    
      <section><h1 class="display-4">My Work!</h1>
      <p class="lead">The problem: 
        The user is attempting to file a complaint on the website due to extended wait times on the listed phone number.
        <br>
        The Solution: 
        Redesign the website to make it user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly find necessary information.</p>
    
      <p>My Role:  User Experience & Interface Design, User Research 
        Tools:  Figma, Miro, Google Drive, Canva</p>
      </section>
<h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I started this process by trying to understand who would be going to the Federal Communications Commission’s website. From there I created my proto-persona, a young woman named Anisha Compuz. She is a city girl, with a passion for starting something new,and is  trying to understand the regulations for to contact FCC to start her own company.</p>

      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p><blockquote>Upon conducting a heuristic evaluation of both the desktop and mobile versions of the FCC website, I observed several significant issues with the current site. Primarily, there was an excessive amount of textual content, overwhelming users. Additionally, the absence of a help button hindered users who might have become lost or confused while navigating the site. Lastly, the placement of elements, including images and text, seemed haphazard and lacked a deliberate and organized arrangement on the page.</blockquote></p>

<h3>Color Analysis</h3>
<p><blockquote>Once finishing with the heuristic evaluation, I went through and wanted to check the accessibility of the colors, and fonts of this site. I felt the colors were a good fit for the site and decided to keep them for my redesign.However,there were some issues with FCC passing the AA test. The website did not pass the color blind accessibility test.</blockquote></p>

    <section>
<h3>Usability tests on current site</h3>
<p><blockquote>I conducted five usability tests of the current site to see what Anisha, my proto proto-persona, would go through if I gave her five tasks.All users completed their tasks, but for some tasks it took a while for the user to be able to complete the tasks. There was a lot of information on the website, and the users found it challenging to maneuver through. I combined my notes from these tests into a diagram and created a affinity diagram of sorts.Followed by that, I went through the list to make the necessary changes to the redesign.
</blockquote></p>
<p>I created an empathy map from my findings to gain a deeper understanding of users' needs, goals, and emotions. From there I took what was important to our user Anisha and created a 2x2 competitive matrix to show the range of importance to the user and FCC. This shows us what specific adjustments to the site have priority over the others</p>

      <h3>Annotations</h3>
      <p><blockquote>
        Using my findings above, I went through and annotated the desktop website to help myself visual things that needed to be changed.

Annotating this government website served several important purposes:

It helped Identify pain points: Annotations highlight usability issues and user frustrations for focused improvement.

It helped Document observations: Annotations serve as a record of findings and insights for reference throughout the redesign process.

It helped Facilitate collaboration: Annotations enable visual communication and feedback among team members and stakeholders.

  <h3>Definition & Ideation</h3>
  <p>Once we gathered all of our research and defined the problem, we were able to brainstorm what features would most benefit our users, and then translate that experience emotionally through our user journey map and storyboard.</p>
</section>
  </p>

  <section><h3>Moodboard</h3>
  <p>We created a moodboard to know and understand the flow of the colors, the patterns and the design. This also helped us to understand what the users look for.</p>
        This led us into coming up with the style guide for the website. 
        <img src="images/styleguidefcc.png" width="800" height="700"><br><br>
        The UI Style guide I created successfully captures a playful and lively tone that I wanted for the FCC website that deals with serious topics. By infusing elements of fun colors and imagery into the design, the style guide ensures a delightful user experience while maintaining the necessary seriousness and professionalism required for the content.

        <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>I utilized card sorting to improve the navigation of the FCC website.I took help from my teammates, and sorted the cards through, and organized them keeping our user persona and the interviews in mind.</p>
        From there I was able to take the results of the card sorting (to the right) and make my improved sitemap shown below.

        <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
        <blockquote>After finalizing the sitemap, I transitioned to wireframing the navigation and home page of the FCC website. These simplified visuals allowed for me to do five second usability tests on the home page as well.
<h4>Five Second Usability Tests</h4>
The five-second usability test was a quick and effective way for me to evaluate the initial impression of my design of the home page within a very short timeframe. I aimed to assess whether users could quickly grasp the purpose, content, and key elements of my design and if they found it pleasing. Five volunteers participated in the five-second usability test, which was conducted using a dedicated testing platform.
<p>I took the positive and negative feedback, and implemented the desired changes, and retested it before applying the UI.</p>
<h3>Mid-Fi Wireframes</h3>

<p><h2>Hi-Fi Frames & Prototyping</h2>
By combining my style guide with the low-fidelity wireframes, I were able to create high-fidelity prototypes that showcase the visual aesthetic and design elements while keeping true to the feedback from my beginning usability tests of the original site. This integration ensures that the prototype reflects the desired look and feel of the final product, providing a realistic representation of the user experience.</p>
